Bet Buddies- Final project Joshua Phelps and Garrett Bennett
Sports fans are highly social and competitive. Sports betting is growing, but there is a gap in the market. There is no platform out there that combines betting with social forums/ leagues/ challenges. This is what Bet buddy aims to solve.
 
We will use supabase and a nextjs tech stack. There are also many APIs that will allow us to integrate with existing sportsbooks to track live lines and odds.
 
We plan on building out the ability to create an account, load in fake money, place a parlay, track it, and track friends parlays. Hopefully somewhat functional by the end of the semester.
 
We believe this is very achievable. Probably won't have a nice front-end but what can you do. This project will definitely require more effort after the semester ends if we want to pursue it.
 
We are interested in this because we are both big sports fans. And we love fantasy sports. This is also something that our sports betting friends have expressed would be cool to have.
